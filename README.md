### Summary

SeeV as a project will be an app for users to make their CVs easily, a data collection to use to market products, and a platform for companies to hire people based on their skills.

Users, will create an account, enter their personal data through a form, choose CV templates (for their data) then download or share it. Their data will be sent back to our servers. All this in a slick mobile app.

We, have a web dashboard that accesses the data of all our users stored in the servers, and provides the ability to search and target groups, for marketing purposes (i.e. finding people likely to buy a course based on their skills). And we will have extensive data visualization and analysis. It will also list all company accounts, create and delete them, and let us update their permissions.

Companies, will have access to a web app, create an account, and get (permission based) access to CVs of the users to hire as employees. They can filter and search the data completely.
